In Apache Cassandra, consistent hashing is a core part of its architecture, but it is controlled and managed by the Partitioner and Gossip Protocol. Let's break down how it works and which components play a role:
Key Components That Control Consistent Hashing
1. Partitioner

    The partitioner is responsible for determining the hashing algorithm used to assign data partitions (rows) to specific nodes in the cluster.
    It maps each rowâ€™s partition key to a token value within the hash space (a circular ring).
    Cassandra's default partitioner is Murmur3Partitioner, which provides good distribution and performance.

2. Token Assignment

    Each node is assigned a token range on the hash ring. This defines which portion of the data the node is responsible for.
    Virtual nodes (vNodes) allow each physical node to be responsible for multiple token ranges, improving load balancing.

3. Gossip Protocol

    Nodes communicate with each other using the Gossip Protocol to maintain an updated view of the cluster.
    This protocol helps nodes become aware of changes, such as new nodes joining or existing nodes leaving.

4. Replication Strategy

    The replication strategy (like SimpleStrategy or NetworkTopologyStrategy) works alongside consistent hashing to determine how many copies of the data are distributed across different nodes.

5. Dynamic Snitching

    Ensures efficient data routing by keeping track of node performance and adjusting routing decisions accordingly.

Gossip Protocol:
Gossip Protocol in Cassandra

The Gossip Protocol in Apache Cassandra is a peer-to-peer communication mechanism that allows nodes in the cluster to share information about their status and the status of other nodes. It ensures that all nodes maintain an up-to-date view of the cluster, enabling fault-tolerance and dynamic scaling.
Key Characteristics

    Decentralized: No single point of control; every node communicates with other nodes independently.
    Periodic and Probabilistic: Nodes gossip at regular intervals with randomly chosen peers.
    Efficient: Requires minimal bandwidth and resources for communication.
    Eventually Consistent: Nodes may not have identical views immediately but will converge over time.

How Gossip Works

    Startup Phase:
        When a node starts, it contacts a few seed nodes (pre-configured, well-known nodes) to initiate the gossip process.

    Regular Gossiping:
        Each node selects a few random peers to share state information, including:
            Node status (up/down)
            Schema versions (to detect schema changes)
            Token ownership information
            Load metrics

    State Propagation:
        The information spreads through the cluster as each node gossips with others.
        Eventually, all nodes receive consistent information about the cluster.

    Failure Detection:
        Nodes detect failures by tracking missing gossip messages and marking nodes as down.

Gossip Messages

There are three main types of messages exchanged:

    Application State: Information about schema, token ranges, and other node metadata.
    Heartbeats: Used to monitor node liveness.
    Versioning: Ensures updates are consistent across the cluster.

Benefits

    Scalability: Works well with large clusters.
    Resilience: No central point of failure.
    Low Latency: Information spreads rapidly and efficiently.

Example Scenario

When a new node is added:

    The new node contacts seed nodes and begins gossiping.
    Other nodes learn about the new node through gossip.
    Token ranges are rebalanced, and data is redistributed.
